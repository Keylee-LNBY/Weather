This application pulls in the Open Weather API and display current and future weather conditions for a city of the users choice. The user will find the following features: 

- Ability to search multiple cities and see search history on the left hand side of the page 
- Ability to go back and click on those historical searches to bring up the lastest weather 
- Last search user created will appear upon page load 
- UV index with color indicator 
- Both current weather and weather for the next five days

This app gave me the opportunity to push myself in generating almost an entire page dynamically. Having started out hard coding each div to hold the current weather and five day outlook I quickly discovered how much more work that created in Javascript. So I started over again creating the page as the user searches. 

This was a good challange and I've learned a lot from building this app. In the future I hope to include more weather information and maybe three temperatures and times throughout the day for better planning.
